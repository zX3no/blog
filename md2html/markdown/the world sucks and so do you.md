# Everything sucks and so do you.

I'm not keeping this. Just a tone setter.

After a great night of sleep, you turn on your phone for an early morning dopamine injection, only to
discover something horrible.

Yet another billionare's corruption has come to light! You angrily comment about how evil the world is
and how corruption always goes unpunished.

You're flooded with praise and respect for saying what most people wouldn't.
You start your day feeling a little more hopeful of the future.

## Everything is a nail.


I was reading a
[reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/zry65d/found_this_letter_from_1979_while_remodeling_my/)
where someone had discovered a letter while remodeling a house.
The letter was written 23rd of May 1979. It reads as follows:

> Hi, (??) 105 in the Shade,
> New tiles are being put in the bathroom tomorrow.
> The U.S.A is going broke. Carter is our president right now.
> Hope when you find this, things will be better.
>
> Good luck,
>
> Rudolph Matejka

One of the comments of this post reads:

>“Hope when you find this things will be better.”
>
>Narrator: “They were not.”


>>> You know I don't think people actually mean this when they say it. I what the mean to say is, I don't like the way things are now and I don't know history.

If you want to know why this is not true, just look at violent crime around 89':

Not good, at least for today's standards.

It's interesting people are starting to believe


## The world is getting worse.

*"The planet is dying, the government hates us, the animals are leaving and the aliens aren't contacting us."*

At one point this was a joke, but now days', people are starting to believe it.

**Probably going to need some good evidence to prove this.**

The thinking:
- The world sucks
- Governments are useless or corupt
- Companies are evil and corrupt
- Billionares are evil and corrupt
- Religious people are evil and corrupt or rapists.
- No matter what happens nothing will change.
- Life is hopeless and the world is fucked.

The problems:
- Economic hardship
- Religious disagreements
- IDPOL disagreements
- Abortion
- Something about capitalism and colonialism
- America bad
- Health Care

The reason:
- Poor understanding of issues
- Underestimating complexity
- Often things are the way they are for a good reason
- While people agree on outcomes (like better healthcare) they don't agree on how to do it.
- Mental Illness
- Over-externalising issues.
- Since people are so quick to adjust to their lifestyle. They may think that things were better in the past.
- The grass is greener on the other side.
- More and more people are socially isolated. Many people are developing unrealistic views of the world.
- It's very human to assume the worst.

Things that don't help:
- Social Media. People are drawn to controversy and social media makes it easy to find.
- Misleading headlines.
