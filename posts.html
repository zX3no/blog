                    A lot has changed since I wrote my first blog post on how to write kernel drivers with Rust. I
                    learned more about the
                    language and worked on more projects. The goal of this blog post is to keep you updated on the
                    changes from the last 2
                    years.

                    A friend of mine recently brought up his custom mechanical keyboard while we were hanging out in
                    voice
                    chat, and at first, nobody understood why anyone would buy one. At that time, I had no clue that
                    there
                    are entire communities about building custom keyboards. With every sentence that was said, we got
                    deeper
                    into this community. We explored different YouTube channels, watched comparisons, and listened to
                    sound
                    tests.

                    Only a few hours later, all of us were hooked and wanted to build our own keyboards as well. This
                    post
                    will go over all the parts that are needed, what they are for, and what you need to watch out for.

                    I'm currently writing an AMD hypervisor in Rust and there I need to allocate memory for lots of
                    different structures.
                    And not all of them use the same memory, so I decided to create a helper structure to allocate and
                    deallocate it for me.
