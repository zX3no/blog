        <p>A <a href="https://github.com/sariaki">friend of mine</a> recently brought up his custom mechanical keyboard
            while we were hanging out in voice chat, and at first, nobody understood why anyone would buy one. At that
            time, I had no clue that there are entire <a
                href="https://reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">communities</a> about building custom keyboards. With
            every sentence that was said, we got deeper into this community. We explored different YouTube channels,
            watched comparisons, and listened to sound tests.</p>
        <p>Only a few hours later, all of us were hooked and wanted to build our own keyboards as well. This post will
            go over all the parts that are needed, what they are for, and what you need to watch out for.</p>
