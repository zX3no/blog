- [ ] Compile math instead of rendering at runtime. (HARD, LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] Table of contents on right-side of post. (HARD, LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] Simplify reference system. I know zola has a system for it. (HARD, MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Diagrams.
- [ ] Since ID's are used a lot, they should be prefixed with something. When creating citations and in post links like [](#blog). There might be some overlap. So change, #post to #zx-post or something. Maybe id's can be localized or something?
- [ ] Multiline summaries in post metadata.
- [ ] Fix syntax highlighting theme.
- [ ] Delete compiled posts that aren't in the markdown list anymore.
- [ ] All the margins are wrong especially around the footnotes.
- [ ] CLS on KaTex
- [ ] Reference section needs indentation on the content see (i. Sample rate, ii. Sampels).
- [ ] Pagination (or should there be infinite scrolling)
- [ ] Improve performance of syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add a nav bar or improve page navigation with better back button.
- [ ] Minify `style.css`
