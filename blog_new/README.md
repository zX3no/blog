```
/markdown - stores markdown files
/build - stores the full compiled website
/site - the website which will link to files in /build
/templates - stores the templates to be compiled
/assets - fonts, styles, images, etc.
/src - the compiler
```

TODO:
Maybe markdown files need a heading for the page and a title for the post list. IDK.
