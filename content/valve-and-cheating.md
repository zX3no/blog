### What the Valve doin?

For quite a while I've wondered why so many players cheat in Counter-Strike. 
It feels like every other game someone is cheating.
I say *feels*, because it's not true, however it's enough to raise suspicions.
Everytime you die there is a part of you that wonders if they were cheating or not.
Was it my mistake or was there nothing I could've done.
And then when finally someone is blatently cheating you feel relieved because you knew all along.

Cheating is so destructive that the game is broken as a new player.
As a new player you will be queued with other new players and unfortunatly that means cheaters.
The new player experience is by far the worst out of any game.

What does Valve do about it?

Firstly. 
People can pay for a *'better matchmaking'*; without this, I don't know how you can play the game.
Despite this it's still littered with cheaters, so that's a no go.

Secondly. There is Valve Anti-Cheat. Which reminds me of that meme where there is a gate and tire tracks around it.

There is also Overwatch, in which players can review cases and determine if players are cheating. 
90% of these cases will be a waste of time since they are blatent spinbotters.
Although it is sometimes fun, this does not positivly effect the game in any way.
Plus they have not created an automatic system to ban people spinning around in circles and still hitting shots, is astounding.
If you want to use *'they could accendentially ban someone'* as an excuse I'll get to that later.
It seems Overwatch sorts it's cases based by most reported, and since there is so many cheaters. 
You'll never get a difficult case.
I think WarOwl has a video about this.

#### Why the people cheatin?

Cheating in Counter-Strike is disproportionately high. 
Altough I have no metrics for this. 
I have never seen a spinbotter in another game. 
I know the names for the different cheats: Anti-Aim, Spin-Bot, Trigger-Bot, Aim-bot, Wall-hack, Soft-aim.
I learned all of this from just playing the game. Which is a huge red flag.
Valorant for example does not have this problem. It may have a few cheaters but nothing like CS:GO.
It's not just the amount of cheating but also the extreme was that they are cheating.

#### Cheating ingrained into the culture of Counter-Strike.

TLDR; it's easy to do, it's effective and it's expected

CS is one of the oldest FPS games, probably the oldest that is still played.
I don't know what this has to do with cheating.

CS is probably one of the most difficult and skillful video games that exist. 
Cheating also gives you a massive advantage compared to other games.
What impact does cheating in League of Legends have?
Could the game possible become less fun.
You don't need to cheat a lot to impact the game. 
A lil' wall hacking will allow you to win 90% of your games.
Worst of all, people who wallhack delude themselves into thinking they are good since they don't use aimhacks.

It is almost expected to play against cheaters and people have become desensitised too it.
So much so that they don't care enough to complain about it.

#### You won't get banned

I've been tracking some of the blatent hackers that I've played against.
They have not been banned.
Valve anti-cheat measures are so un-effective cheaters can have knifes for thousands of hours blatently cheating without getting banned.
[maybe a link to the profile?]
If there is no fear of getting banned why not cheat?

#### What can be done about it?

This is probably going to be the most interesting and controversial part.

I'm going to throw out a wild idea right now.
While there are problems with anti-cheat, the main reason CS:GO has so many cheaters is because of VAC's ban length.
For those who don't know, "once a cheater always a cheater".
VAC bans every play permentantly, it does not matter if we're angry, a kid, if 100 years have gone by, you will still be banned.
Once a cheater always a cheater and how many cheaters we have.

Counter Strike has been around for a long time, longer than any other FPS game.  
CS:GO offically launched in augest 2012, 10 years ago.

if you where banned 10 years ago you would still be banned.

#### Why does this matter

One of the most important parts of a justice system is not the pushment,but what comes after.
Most people don't go to prison for life.
Recidivism is often quite high. 
However for certain countries (Norway), the rates can be quite low.
It might seem weird that i'm comparing cheating to life in prison, however that is how Valve is treating it.
How many of you are the same person last year as you are today.
If you say yes, I feel bad for you.

#### Why being unbanned is so important.

If there is no opportunity to grow from your mistakes why would you.

Let's think of a hypothetical.
You are 16 years old. 
You've played CS for a few hundred hours and you like the game enough to own a knife.
Your playing matchmaking and someone starts spinnbotting.
Unfortunatly your high-school crush has just rejected you so your feeling extra tilted today and you download some hack.
The next day your banned for life.
You don't just lose the ability to play CS:GO.
You lose your steam account. 
If you want to play CS you'll need a second account and nobody wants to swap back and forth.
All of the games you bought on Steam are on your main.
You also have a huge ugly ban message on your profile.
I personally like my profile and would not like that.
They also can't send gifts to friends.

Oh but they will hide it on your profile after 10 years!

People love the steam accounts so much, that they refuse to use any other platform(epic games).


[section on when i was banned]

--- 

With a strict ban policy there is no room for making any mistakes, which a more agressive anti-cheat will have.
Cheating creates cheating, is exponential.
